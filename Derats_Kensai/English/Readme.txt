This module allows you to give all the abilities and disadvantages of the kensai to any class.

To do so, purchase the Kensaïsator Ring:
- from Talantir in BG2EE
- from Ribald in BG2EE
- from Orrick the Grey in IWDEE.

Then equip the ring on any character you want to give the attributes of a kensai: he will gain:
- Armor Class: +2
- Hit and damage: +1 every 3 levels
- Initiative: +1 and +1 every 4 levels (Corrected and functional (as it was bugged in the base game))
- Kai ability every 4 levels
- Inability to wear bracelets, armor, and robes (even with the “Use All Items” hla).

----------------------------

The ring can only be used once per character: equip it, reuse it on other characters if you want, then sell it.

Equipping the ring causes you to unequip all your items: this is to prevent cheating by wearing armor and bracelets that are “red but never removed.”

The “per level” bonuses are managed by script, and the way the game calculates levels is peculiar, as follows:
- A single-class character will receive the full bonuses for +16 damage at level 48.
- A multi-class character will receive half the bonuses, for +7 damage at levels 21/24 (the least effective class counts).
- Characters with dual classes “bug out” for some reason I don't understand. For example, Imoen, level 7 thief and level 31 mage, only has +6 damage in the end. I don't know why.
